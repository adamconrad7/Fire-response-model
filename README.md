# Fire-response-model
A machine learning model that uses weather data to predict fire behavior.
Specifically, it reads weather data from seven different sites across the Northwest Geographic Area (Oregon and Washington) and takes the average of this data. The program then uses a k-nearest-neighbor algorithm to train the model to predict the National Interagency Fire Center's prepardness level for that area on a given date. The model is able to predict the region's prepardness level on any given date from that day's wether data to 96% accuracy.
